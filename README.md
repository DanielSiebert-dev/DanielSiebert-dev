## 🌌 About the Warlock
With 12+ years wielding finance, controlling, and IT magic (7 years mastering SAP), I’ve conjured strategic programs, ERP rituals, and software integrations to optimize financial realms. My grimoire now blends DevSecOps spells—AWS, Terraform, Docker, and CI/CD pipelines—with new incantations: PostgreSQL performance tuning with PgBouncer and Node.js wizardry for stable, scalable apps.  

I channel JIRA, Confluence, and testing runes to fuse finance and tech, crafting lean workflows and cost-saving artifacts. A veteran of leadership crusades (leading teams of 12) and technical quests, I’ve driven transformations and sparked innovations.  

My quest evolves: from financial lore to cloud mastery, merging ERP expertise with automation and security to forge efficient, unbreakable solutions. As part of the African Trading Club, I apply tech to boost trade operations in Tanzania, weaving DevSecOps and financial alchemy into epic scalable tools—all while ruling with PyCharm!  

## 🕒 My Epic Quest
- 🌐 Mastered financial control, global IT budgeting, and ERP deployments.
- 💻 Earned AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner and Solutions Architect Associate via a Cloud Engineering odyssey.
- 🔒 Thriving as a DevSecOps intern at webeet.io, hacking automation, security, and infra with PyCharm as my wand.
- 📊 Optimized PostgreSQL with PgBouncer, stabilized Node.js apps with Healthchecks and Smoke Tests.

## 🚀 Recent Conquest: Observability Stack
**Timestamp: 2025-08-26 22:23 CEST**  
This cycle warped by—peak sprint mode where you blink and behold a citadel! With my tribe, we forged an observability stack from the void in 7 legendary steps.  

### Treasures Gained:
- ✅ Ansible playbooks + templates sealed in S3’s vault
- ✅ IAM + Security Groups enchanted with least-privilege, zero-trust runes
- ✅ AWS SSM Run Command casting playbooks (no SSH, no exposed IPs!)
- ✅ Filebeat shipping logs to Logstash → Elasticsearch → Kibana
- ✅ JSON logging + rotation etched at the app layer  

Each move iterated, validated with `terraform validate`, and stacked with precision. Fast, secure, testable—pure DevSecOps glory!  

**Next Crusade:** Summoning Infracost for financial impact divination, blending infra and finance mastery.  

Kudos to my squad 🙌—a razor-sharp legion sprinting at lightspeed.

## 😂 Nerd Meme of the Cycle
Why did the DevSecOps wizard fail at stand-up? Because he kept encrypting the punchline! 😂
