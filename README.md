## 🌌 About the Warlock
With 12+ years as a finance wizard, conjuring Budget Scrolls and Profit Potions with 7 years of SAP sorcery, I’ve optimized financial realms. As the warlord of Squad C & E—leading four trusty lieutenants to make us five—I wield DevSecOps runes: AWS, Terraform, Docker, and CI/CD pipelines, blended with Deep-Tech magic like PgBouncer shields and Node.js elixirs for scalable apps.  

I orchestrate our code odyssey through a Teambranch, reviewing every line before merging into the Development branch after epic council nods. A veteran of ledger crusades (leading teams of 12) and tech quests, I’ve transformed chaos into gold. Currently, I’m brewing the FinOps Certified Practitioner potion to master cost optimization. As part of the African Trading Club, I cast tech spells to boost Tanzania’s trade—all while ruling with PyCharm!  

## 🕒 My Epic Quest
- 🌐 Mastered financial control, global IT budgeting, and ERP deployments with a ledger’s precision.
- 💻 Earned AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner and Solutions Architect Associate, forging my Cloud Engineering path.
- 🔒 Led Squad C & E as a DevSecOps intern at webeet.io, hacking automation and security with Deep-Tech wands.
- 📊 Tamed PostgreSQL with PgBouncer, stabilized Node.js apps with Healthchecks and Smoke Tests.
- 💰 Brewing FinOps Certified Practitioner to revolutionize cost alchemy.

## 🚀 Epic Achievements
### Observability Citadel
With my tribe, I erected an observability fortress, weaving Ansible scrolls, IAM zero-trust runes, AWS SSM chants, and an ELK stronghold (Filebeat, Logstash, Elasticsearch, Kibana) with JSON logging. Validated with `terraform validate`, it’s a beacon of speed and security.  

### PgBouncer & Node.js Triumph
I banished the chaos of PgBouncer’s transaction pooling clashing with PostgreSQL’s prepared statements, tweaking the Node.js driver, adding healthchecks, smoke tests (200 → 503 → 200), and cleaning repo clutter. A shield against finance downtime!  

### PostgreSQL Performance Forge
Unraveled PostgreSQL’s resource curse—escalating backends choking scaling—and forged PgBouncer to guard it, limiting sockets and mastering processes. The truth: the bottleneck is Postgres’s appetite, not PgBouncer’s might.  

### FinOps Realm: Cost Dominion
As Squad C & E’s FinOps warlord, I orchestrated automated cost controls for QA, taming runaway expenses with tags and purging orphaned resources. Conquered Auto-Stop (#62), Budget Alerts (#63), Cleanup (#64), Office Hours (#65), and a Cost Dashboard (#66), all with a dedicated Postgres vault.  

### server.js & Infra Alignment
Aligned our app and infra with PgBouncer-safe patterns, crafting a single Pool, ditching prepared statements, and adding /health, /ready, /readyz portals. Tuned Docker and pgbouncer.ini, verifying backups to banish inefficiency.
