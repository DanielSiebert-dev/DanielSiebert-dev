## üìú About Me
With 12+ years in the arcane arts of finance, controlling, and IT financial management‚Äî7 of those mastering SAP‚ÄîI‚Äôve conjured strategic programs, ERP deployments, and software integrations to optimize financial realms. My grimoire includes process automation, cross-functional synergy, and system enhancements, powered by a robust tech stack: AWS, Terraform, Docker, and CI/CD pipelines for scalable, battle-tested cloud fortresses.

I wield JIRA, Confluence, and testing rituals to bridge finance and tech, crafting streamlined reporting and workflow optimizations. A veteran of both technical and leadership quests, I‚Äôve led teams, sparked innovation, and spearheaded transformation crusades.

Now, I‚Äôm transmuting into a software development sage, fueled by a passion for automation, security, and innovation. This evolution fuses my financial process mastery, ERP wisdom, and cloud sorcery to forge tools that amplify business efficiency.

Beyond that, I‚Äôm an active member of the African Trading Club, an elite cabal of investors harnessing innovative models for African trade. I channel tech to optimize trade ops, drive digital metamorphosis, and unlock potential in hotspots like Tanzania. This trifecta of finance, cloud mastery, and global trade lets me wield both strategic and technical might, birthing efficiency and economic opportunities.

My mission? To meld DevSecOps, financial alchemy, and software crafting into scalable, high-impact solutions for chaotic business domains. All while wielding my trusty IDE, PyCharm, like a lightsaber of code!

## üìñ My Journey
My saga began in the financial dungeons, mastering strategic planning, cost optimization, and process efficiency. I ruled global IT budgeting, deployed ERP systems, and commanded teams of up to 12 across distant lands. A quest for tech enlightenment via advanced software and project management training ignited my cloud obsession. After conquering a Cloud Engineering program‚Äîmastering Python, Flask, AWS, Docker, and more‚ÄîI earned the sacred scrolls of AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner and Solutions Architect, plus HashiCorp Terraform Associate. Now, as a DevSecOps Engineer intern, I wield automation, security, and infrastructure hacks to defend the digital realm.

## üöÄ Recent Work: Observability Stack
**Logged on: 2025-08-26 17:37 CEST**  
This cycle blurred past‚Äîpeak sprint mode where you glance up and see a fortress built! With my crew, we bootstrapped an observability stack from void to a fully integrated pipeline in 7 epic steps.  

### Loot Acquired:
- ‚úÖ Ansible playbooks + templates stashed in S3‚Äôs vault
- ‚úÖ IAM + Security Groups locked down with least-privilege, zero-trust runes
- ‚úÖ AWS SSM Run Command casting playbooks (no SSH, no exposed IPs!)
- ‚úÖ Filebeat shipping structured logs to Logstash ‚Üí Elasticsearch ‚Üí Kibana
- ‚úÖ JSON logging + log rotation forged at the app layer

Each move was iterative, validated with `terraform validate`, and stacked with precision. Fast, secure, testable‚Äîtrue DevSecOps craftsmanship!  

Verdict? I lived for every nanosecond. This fusion of cloud engineering, security wards, and automation is my coder‚Äôs nirvana.  

**Next Quest:** Summoning Infracost to the pipeline‚Äîobservability‚Äôs incomplete without financial impact analysis. Infra + Finance = my ultimate realm to conquer!  

Shoutout to my squad üôå‚Äîa razor-sharp, collab-heavy tribe that sprints at warp speed.
