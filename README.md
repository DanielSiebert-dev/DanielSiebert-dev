## 🌌 About the Warlock
With over a decade of financial expertise, including 7 years mastering SAP to streamline budgets and processes, I’ve turned ledger magic into tangible results. As the team lead of Squad C & E, guiding a dedicated group of four to form our unit of five, I leverage DevSecOps tools—AWS, Terraform, Docker, and CI/CD—alongside advanced technologies like PgBouncer and Node.js to build robust, scalable solutions.  

I oversee our development workflow, reviewing code in the Teambranch before merging into the Development branch with team consensus. With a proven track record of leading teams of 12 and driving technological innovation, I’m now enhancing my skills with the FinOps Certified Practitioner course—because who doesn’t love turning budgets into code gold? As a member of the African Trading Club, I apply tech to elevate trade operations in Tanzania, blending finance and innovation with a smile.

## 🕒 My Epic Quest
- 🌐 Excelled in financial control, global IT budgeting, and ERP implementations with precision.
- 💻 Achieved AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner and Solutions Architect Associate, shaping my cloud expertise.
- 🔒 Lead Squad C & E as a DevSecOps intern at webeet.io, mastering automation and security.
- 📊 Optimized PostgreSQL with PgBouncer and stabilized Node.js applications with Healthchecks and Smoke Tests.
- 💰 Pursuing FinOps Certified Practitioner to refine cost management strategies.

## 🚀 Epic Achievements
### Observability Citadel
Collaborated with my team to construct a robust observability stack, integrating Ansible, IAM with zero-trust policies, AWS SSM, and an ELK suite (Filebeat, Logstash, Elasticsearch, Kibana) with JSON logging—validated with Terraform for top-tier performance.

### PgBouncer & Node.js Triumph
Resolved the clash between PgBouncer’s transaction pooling and PostgreSQL’s prepared statements, adjusting the Node.js driver, implementing healthchecks, and running smoke tests (200 → 503 → 200)—a reliable shield for financial systems.

### PostgreSQL Performance Forge
Uncovered PostgreSQL’s scaling bottleneck—resource-heavy backends—and deployed PgBouncer to manage connections efficiently, proving the real challenge lies in database resource demands, not the tool.

### FinOps Realm: Cost Dominion
As Squad C & E’s FinOps lead, I engineered automated cost controls for QA, using tags to track expenses and clearing orphaned resources. Successfully delivered Auto-Stop (#62), Budget Alerts (#63), Cleanup (#64), Office Hours (#65), and a Cost Dashboard (#66), all backed by a dedicated Postgres setup.

### server.js & Infra Alignment
Realigned our application and infrastructure with PgBouncer-safe designs, creating a streamlined Pool, removing outdated statements, and adding /health, /ready, /readyz endpoints. Optimized Docker and pgbouncer.ini, ensuring robust backups—efficiency wins!

## 😂 Nerd Meme of the Cycle
Why did the accountant become a coder?
To debug budgets with a smirk—because nothing says 'event sourcing' like turning a ledger into a microservice, only to find the bug was in the accountant’s coffee break! 😂
