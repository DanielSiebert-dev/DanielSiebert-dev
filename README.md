## 🌌 About the Warlock
With 12+ years wielding finance, controlling, and IT magic (7 years mastering SAP), I’ve conjured strategic programs, ERP rituals, and software integrations to optimize financial realms. As the warlord leading Squad C and E—commanding a legion of four fellow warriors, making us five strong—my grimoire blends DevSecOps spells—AWS, Terraform, Docker, and CI/CD pipelines—with potent runes: PostgreSQL performance tuning with PgBouncer and Node.js wizardry for scalable apps.  

I orchestrate our code odyssey through a Teambranch, where I review every line, merging into the Development branch after epic council approvals. A veteran of leadership crusades (leading teams of 12) and technical quests, I’ve driven transformations and sparked innovations. Currently, I’m mastering the FinOps Certified Practitioner course, enhancing my quest with financial optimization sorcery.  

My journey evolves: from financial lore to cloud mastery, merging ERP expertise with automation and security. As part of the African Trading Club, I apply tech to boost trade operations in Tanzania, weaving DevSecOps and financial alchemy into epic, scalable solutions—all while ruling with PyCharm!  

## 🕒 My Epic Quest
- 🌐 Mastered financial control, global IT budgeting, and ERP deployments.
- 💻 Earned AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner and Solutions Architect Associate via a Cloud Engineering odyssey.
- 🔒 Led Squad C & E as a DevSecOps intern at webeet.io, hacking automation, security, and infra with PyCharm as my wand.
- 📊 Optimized PostgreSQL with PgBouncer, stabilized Node.js apps with Healthchecks and Smoke Tests.
- 💰 Pursuing FinOps Certified Practitioner to master cost optimization.

## 🚀 Epic Achievements
### Observability Citadel
With my tribe, I forged an unbreakable observability stack, weaving Ansible playbooks, IAM with zero-trust runes, AWS SSM Run Command, and an ELK fortress (Filebeat, Logstash, Elasticsearch, Kibana) with JSON logging. Validated with `terraform validate`, it stands as a testament to speed, security, and testability.  

### PgBouncer & Node.js Mastery
I vanquished the chaos of PgBouncer’s transaction pooling clashing with PostgreSQL prepared statements, adjusting the Node.js driver to avoid named prepares, adding healthchecks, smoke tests (200 → 503 → 200), and cleaning repo structures for lean infra. This stabilizes high-load systems, reducing downtime risks for finance realms.  

### PostgreSQL Performance Forge
Unveiled PostgreSQL’s resource curse—escalating backend processes crippling scaling—and wielded PgBouncer to shield it, limiting sockets and controlling processes. The key: the bottleneck is PostgreSQL’s hunger, not PgBouncer’s memory.  

### FinOps Realm: Automated Cost Dominion
As Squad C & E’s FinOps warlord, I orchestrated automated cost controls for our QA layer-infra, preventing runaway costs with tags and cleaning orphaned resources. Sub-quests conquered include Auto-Stop (#62), Budget Alerts (#63), Cleanup (#64), Office Hours (#65), and a Cost Dashboard (#66), all greenlit with a dedicated Postgres volume and transaction pooling.  

### server.js & Infra Alignment
Aligned our app and infra with PgBouncer-safe patterns, crafting a single Pool, removing prepared statements, and adding /health, /ready, /readyz endpoints. Docker and pgbouncer.ini were tuned, with backup-restore workflows verified, replacing inefficient pools for scalable efficiency.

## 😂 Nerd Meme of the Cycle
Why did the DevSecOps wizard fail at stand-up? Because he kept encrypting the punchline! 😂
