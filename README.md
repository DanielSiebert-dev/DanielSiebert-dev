## 📜 About Me
With 12+ years mastering finance, controlling, and IT (7 years with SAP), I’ve cast strategic programs, ERP spells, and software integrations to optimize financial realms. I wield JIRA, Confluence, and testing rituals to bridge finance and tech, crafting streamlined reporting and workflow hacks. A veteran of leadership and technical quests, I’ve led teams, sparked innovation, and driven transformations.

Now, I’m evolving into a software development sage, fueled by a passion for automation, security, and innovation. This shift fuses my financial process mastery, ERP wisdom, and cloud sorcery to forge DevSecOps tools that boost efficiency.

I’m also in the African Trading Club, an elite cabal optimizing African trade with tech, unlocking potential in regions like Tanzania. My mission: blend DevSecOps, financial alchemy, and software crafting into scalable, high-impact solutions—all while wielding PyCharm like a lightsaber!

## 📖 My Journey
- 🌐 Mastered financial control, global IT budgeting, and ERP deployments.
- 💻 Pivoted to tech via advanced training, earning AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner, Solutions Architect, and Terraform Associate.
- 🔒 Thriving as a DevSecOps intern, hacking automation, security, and infra.

## 🚀 Recent Work: Observability Stack
**Logged on: 2025-08-26 22:15 CEST**  
This cycle blurred past—peak sprint mode where you glance up and see a fortress built! With my crew, we bootstrapped an observability stack from void to a pipeline in 7 epic steps.  

### Loot Acquired:
- ✅ Ansible playbooks + templates stashed in S3’s vault
- ✅ IAM + Security Groups locked with least-privilege, zero-trust runes
- ✅ AWS SSM Run Command casting playbooks (no SSH, no exposed IPs!)
- ✅ Filebeat shipping logs to Logstash → Elasticsearch → Kibana
- ✅ JSON logging + rotation forged at the app layer

Iterative, validated with `terraform validate`, and stacked with precision. Fast, secure, testable—true DevSecOps craftsmanship!  

Loved every nanosecond—this fusion of cloud engineering, security wards, and automation is my coder’s nirvana.  

**Next Quest:** Summoning Infracost for financial impact analysis. Infra + Finance = my realm to conquer!  

Shoutout to my squad 🙌—a razor-sharp tribe sprinting at warp speed.
